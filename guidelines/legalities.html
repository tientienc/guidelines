          <h3>Preventing our trademarks from becoming generic</h3>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>It is important for trademark owners to use their marks, and make sure that others use their marks, to signify a source of goods or services, and to prevent use of their marks as terms that are generally accepted by the public as synonymous with the goods or services themselves. For example, aspirin, once a trademark, became a commonly accepted term for a pain reliever, to the extent that the term is no longer eligible for trademark protection. Similarly, the escalator was once known as the “Escalator,” a trademark that referred to a product of the Otis Escalator Company. However, in 1950, the mark officially became generic when the US Patent and Trademark Office determined that "escalator" had become “recognized by the general public as the name for a moving stairway and not the source thereof.” Once a mark becomes generic, its trademark protections are lost to the owner. Therefore, it is important for trademark owners to guard their marks against becoming generic. This can be accomplished through proper usage of a mark and proper attribution.</p>

              <h4>Guidelines</h4>
              <p class="p-2">Here are some guidelines from our Legal team to help ensure that our trademarks are used properly, both internally and externally:</p>

          <div class="two-rows">
            <div>
              <h3>Always use the trademark as a proper adjective followed by a noun, instead of as a noun or as a verb.</h3>
              <p class="p-2">Each of the LIFEQ marks should always be used as a proper adjective followed by a noun. It would be useful for LifeQ to define its goods and services in generic terms, to be used as nouns following the LIFEQ marks. Using the word “brand” after the trademark can further strengthen the association with a source of goods or services.</p>

              <h3>Make the mark stand out from the rest of the text.</h3>
              <p class="p-2">Another tool a trademark owner can use in print to guard against the mark becoming generic is the application of stylized text or quotation marks to make the mark stand out from the rest of the text. The use of all capital letters, an initial capital letter, quotation marks, or bold, italic or underlined text can accomplish this.</p>

            <div>
              <h3>Use trademark notices (<sup>TM</sup> , <sup>SM</sup>, and &reg;) and attribution lines.</h3>
              <p class="p-2">In addition to the proper usage of trademarks as mentioned above, it is important to notify others that the LIFEQ marks are trademarks and registered trademarks. This may be done by placing the proper trademark symbol (for unregistered marks: a superscript <sup>"TM"</sup> if the mark refers to the goods, or a superscript <sup>"SM"</sup> if the mark refers to the services; for registered marks: the registration symbol "&reg;") after the mark and before the noun it modifies. The <sup>"TM"</sup> and <sup>"SM"</sup> are not mandatory, but these symbols notify third parties that LifeQ claims trademark and service mark rights in the marks. LifeQ does not need federal trademark registrations to use these symbols, and they may be used with any unregistered marks LifeQ is using. The "&reg;" may only be used once federal trademark registration certificates have been issued. For now, please use the <sup>"SM"</sup> or <sup>"TM"</sup> when using the LIFEQ marks or any unregistered marks. Technically the <sup>"SM"</sup> should be used for services, but it is also acceptable and commonplace to use the <sup>"TM"</sup>  if that is easier.</p>

          <p>The proper trademark symbol should be used with the most prominent appearance of the mark, and/or at least the first time the mark appears in text.</p>
          <p>Also, it would be helpful to use an attribution line on software, packaging, manuals, advertisements, and promotional materials. An attribution line may be placed on the inside or back cover of printed materials, or, if the printed materials consist of one page, at the bottom of the page. An example of an appropriate attribution line is: <strong>LIFEQ, POWERED BY LIFEQ, and the Tree logo are trademarks and registered trademarks of LifeQ Global Limited.</strong> It is not necessary to include the trademark symbols (e.g. <sup>TM</sup>, &reg;) in the attribution line.</p>
