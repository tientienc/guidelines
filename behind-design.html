        <h1>Behind the Design</h1>
        <p>The design for the LifeQ brand was inspired by the bold and intricate scientific work done by our team. The design highlights and celebrates this groundbreaking work, and presents it in a comprehensive visual way. Read more about the thinking process behind the brand's design and how the inspiration of a blueprint shaped the LifeQ brand identity.</p>

        <p><i>Creative director Anri Olivier explains her thinking behind the brand:</i></p>

          <img src="assets/behind-the-design/behind-the-design_math.png">
          <p>"The design for the LifeQ brand was both inspired and built by the hands of LifeQ itself. We were trying to find a way to highlight and celebrate the bold, intricate and scientific work of the LifeQ minds, only to then discover a way to take that beautiful structure and communicate it both functionally and visually as a brand. Meaning, find a way to make all these thin lines, numbers and elements come together to communicate something of value and understanding.</p>
          
          <p>"The first solution that came to mind was a blueprint. There is such a beautiful precision behind building blueprints and bringing that complicated, multilayered idea to life, and then finding a way to translate that into a digestible and understandable platform. This is why the blueprint is the solution. It takes the multiple languages of math, engineering and proportion, to only name a few, and turns those pieces into one beautiful document that multiple minds can understand and work from. That is why we thought blueprints would be so appropriate for LifeQ. LifeQ has incredible minds working together. Each has a different language, process and skill set that come together to form one product and can be used and understood by all. Just like LifeQ exists to build better, more optimal wellness, blueprints exist to build a better, more optimal structure. This idea then had a ripple effect of inspirations and answers to any new design problem regarding how to visualize anything LifeQ; in other words, how to design icons, how to incorporate big and small elements, or how to build something from practically nothing.</p>

          <img src="assets/behind-the-design/behind-the-design_grid.png">
          <p>"Blueprints have a beautiful formula that lends a hand in solving just about any new problem. This formula is the grid system. The LifeQ grid plays a HUGE role in how anything is imagined and executed. In some ways one might think that a grid system could serve as yellow tape and keep you from exploring outside the box, but it’s actually been the opposite. It gives you a clear answer if something works or not, and when the answer is 'not', you have the opportunity to reimagine it in an entirely new way, coming up with a solution that is potentially better structurally and serves a better function than that previous attempt. It makes problems more interesting to think about and created a whole new ‘game’ for how to combine the element and its function. After creating the LifeQ grid, solutions were a few scribbles away and those visual elements became easier to execute. Once you have a possible solution, it is easy to apply it to the grid and see its unique qualities and quirks come to life."</p>

            <p>The brand anchors are the foundation of the LifeQ brand and are the key features that make the brand recognizable.</p>

              <li>ALL touchpoints MUST have traces of the brand anchors in order to be recognizable.</li> 
              <li>ALL touchpoints MUST include the logo and LifeQ Dark Blue signature color. The use of iconography is determined on a case-by-case basis.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Icons should never be added randomly, but must always serve a specific purpose.  For example, an icon may be used to replace written-out instructions or headings if it will lead to a simplified user experience, while saving space on the screen. </li>
              <li>Iconography serves as a connection to the LifeQ brand.</li>
